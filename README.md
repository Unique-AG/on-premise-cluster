<h2 align="center">Unique Example Architecture for On-Premise Tenants</h2>

This example architecture outlines how we currently operate Unique on an on-premise tenant. It serves as a guideline for enterprises seeking advice on preparing their infrastructure for on-premise deployment.

<h2>Overview</h2>

This guide is divided into multiple sections:

- [**Hardware**](hardware.md)
We describe the hardware requirements needed to run Unique. Recommendations are provided for both test setups and production environments.

- [**Software Infrastructure**](software-infrastructure.md)
We explain the installation of Kubernetes on the servers, including the setup of networking, monitoring, and relevant dependencies.

- [**Application Layer**](application-layer.md)
Finally, we detail how we deploy Unique to the new on-premise cluster and outline the process for keeping it up to date.
